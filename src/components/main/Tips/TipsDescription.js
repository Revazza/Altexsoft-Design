          Theres nothing hackers love more than a dismissed update reminder. We
          keep our teams computers in shape and up to date so that they arent
          subject to attacks that could otherwise be avoided. Not properly
          updating your systems makes you an easy to reach target and hackers
          will often go after the lowest hanging fruit. When it comes to
          maintaining a strong cybersecurity network the best thing a user can
          do is to prevent problems before they occur, and the easiest way to do
          that is by making sure that all systems are updated and updated
          regularly.
